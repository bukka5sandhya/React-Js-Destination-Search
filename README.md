The following instructions are required for the tests to pass

The search for the destination should be case insensitive. You can use the toLowerCase method to convert a string into lower case letters.

const text = 'Learn JavaScript'
console.log(text.toLowerCase()); // learn javascript

Each DestinationItem should have an HTML image element with alt attribute value as the value of the key name in destinationsList

Things to Keep in Mind

All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.

Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.

Do not remove the pre-filled code
